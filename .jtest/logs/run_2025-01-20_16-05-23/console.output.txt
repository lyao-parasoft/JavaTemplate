The following setup problems have been encountered during analysis:
  Could not report coverage
    - Could not find coverage files, probably instrumentation was not done.
  Other setup problems:
    - No compiled classes were found in the whole testing scope. The project was probably not compiled before Jtest agent was attached.
  Jtest was unable to obtain test results.
    - Jtest was unable to obtain test results because the tests were executed without the Jtest agent. Ensure you add the Jtest agent to your test execution command line.
